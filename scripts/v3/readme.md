# Note to Readers

Important notes that could be helpful to organize or use the scripts, will be listed out in this file.

This volume requires graphs generated from volume 1 & 2 to work properly.

## Known Issues

##### Unrecognized Tactics
Same as tactics in volume 1,several new tactics have been found but due to my limit I cannot determine
the exact propositions that involve within. Below at the progress their appearance should be easy to be found,
and following the scripts their locations on the book should also be easy to be checked out. These tactics include:
- tactic Induct
- tactic []<=
- tactic []>=
- tactic []<
- tactic []<.

##### Proposition Not Found (labeled with `ERROR`s)
Same as in volume 2, these propositions have not found in the book:
- 225.174
- 331.124
- 372.152
